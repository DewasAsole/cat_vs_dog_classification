# cat_vs_dog_classification
This project focuses on classifying images of cats and dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with the help of Keras and OpenCV. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

Features
Uses CNN for image classification
Built with Keras and OpenCV
Includes a video demonstration
Installation
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your_username/cat-dog-classification.git
Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run python train_model.py to train the CNN model.
After training, use python test_model.py to test the model on new images.
Check out the demo_video.mp4 for a visual demonstration.
Results
Achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set.
Confusion matrix and classification report can be found in the results folder.
Future Improvements
Experiment with different CNN architectures for better performance.
Augment the dataset for improved generalization.
